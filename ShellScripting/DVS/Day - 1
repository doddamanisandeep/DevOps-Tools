Example
----------
1. Assume that you need to create a user and password then add it to 1000 servers
then for repetating works we will go with Automation such as Shellscripting &
Python Scripting.

2. You want to check disk usage on 500 servers daily and get alerted if usage > 80%.

3. Deploy a new version of an application on 200 servers

4. You want to check:
     - CPU usage
     - Memory usage
     - Disk usage
     - Running services

==================================================

- Filename should be anything with extension .sh
- First line should be always

IntQ: Why u need to write SheBang Line?
          SheBang line represent in which environment your code should get execute?
          Like 
               bash shell, 
               ksh shell, 
               sh shell
