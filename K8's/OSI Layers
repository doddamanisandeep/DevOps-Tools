Summary of OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) Layers
Layer 7: Application: User interface, application services (HTTP, FTP).
Layer 6: Presentation: Data translation, encryption, compression (SSL/TLS).
Layer 5: Session: Session management (NetBIOS, RPC).
Layer 4: Transport: End-to-end communication, reliability (TCP, UDP).
Layer 3: Network: Logical addressing, routing (IP).
Layer 2: Data Link: Physical addressing, error detection (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Layer 1: Physical: Physical medium, raw bit transmission (cables, NICs).

1. Physical Layer
Function: Responsible for the physical connection between devices, including the transmission and reception of raw binary data over a physical medium.
Examples: Cables (Ethernet, fiber optic), switches, hubs, network interface cards (NICs).
2. Data Link Layer
Function: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the physical layer. It frames the data packets and adds MAC addresses to them.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), switches, bridges.
3. Network Layer
Function: Manages the delivery of packets from the source to the destination across multiple networks. It handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers, IPv4, IPv6.
4. Transport Layer
Function: Ensures reliable data transfer between end systems, including error checking, flow control, and segmentation. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
5. Session Layer
Function: Manages sessions between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
Examples: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
6. Presentation Layer
Function: Translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encryption, decryption, compression, and translation between different data formats.
Examples: SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, MPEG.
7. Application Layer
Function: Provides network services directly to applications. It facilitates communication between software applications and lower layers of the OSI model.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, POP3.
