If we want to schedule some pod in specific nodes the we have concepts called Scheduling.

  NodeSelector: It like startght hit saying loveing someone as ILOVEYOU.
  Node Affinity: It is like more expressive saying i do this for you and all. Means givrs much clarity.  
    NodeAffinity is advanced version of NodeSelector.

    SoftRule (PreferedRule): Pod will assign on a non-matching node if and only if no other node in the cluster matches the specified labels.
          preferedDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution is a prefered rule  affinity.
    HardRule (RequiredRule): If there is no matching nodes then pod wont be scheduled.
                              There are couple of required rules affinites
                              namely 
                                  reuiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
                                  reuiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution


  Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity
  Pod Affinity: It is like if Pod A scheduled in node 1 then Pod B also scheduling in node1
  Pod AntiAffinity: It is opposite of Pod Affinity.


Taints & Tolerations
Taints: Rejecting a pod being scheduling on a node.
      kubectl taint nodes <nodename> <key>=<value>:<effect>
      kubectl taint nodes <nodename> node=HatesPods: NoScheduling
